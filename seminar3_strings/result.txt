"Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin." the first pig said.
"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in," said the wolf.
So he huffed, and he puffed, 
and he blew the house down and ate the little pig right up.
The next day, the big bad wolf came knocking on the second pig's door.
"Little pig, little pig," he said, "let me come in!"
"Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin," the second pig said.
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in," said the wolf.
So he huffed and he puffed, 
and he blew the house down, and ate the little pig right up.
The next day, the big bad wolf came knocking on the third pig's door.
